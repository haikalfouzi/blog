My current focus lies with [Dyson](https://dyson.com), where I leverage my expertise as a Senior Simulation Engineer, utilizing Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) and numerical method to optimize product performance and unlock its secrets.

Previously, I was at [Sapura Energy](https://sapuraenergy.com), where I am responsible for the fabrication project for the 5 years tenure EPCC (Engineering, Procurement, Construction, and Commissioning) of Bokor-Betty Brownfield and Rejuvenation Project started during the end quarter of 2018. Petronas Carigali was undertaking the development of Bokor-Betty field which is located in Miri, Sarawak. Bokor Field was discovered in 1971 and started its production in 1982 putting the current service life of the existing facilities at an average of 33 years. Betty field was discovered in 1968 and started its production in 1978 putting the current service life of the existing facilities at an average 37 years. Therefore, Petronas intends to redevelop and rejuvenation of these facilities/assets to enable them to be fit for use for another 25 years.

From 2018 till 2021, I'm responsible for the construction/fabrication of piping system that'll be installed in 8 platforms (BEP-A, BEDP-A, BNG-B, BOK-A, BOP-A, BODP-A, BODP-B, BODP-C) around the Bokor & Betty oilfield. My team managed to expedite the fabrication progress,  increased the production output rate, and successfully shorten project timeline for completion from 5 years (2018-2023) to 3 years (2018-2021). I've instilled a lean framework project flow into the project in order to successfully achieve team's goal.

Previously I was at [Veolia Energy](https://veolianorthamerica.com), PA as a Mechanical Engineering Co-op in the Greys Ferry Cogeneration Plant. As part of my co-op experience through Drexel University, I was responsible to walk down plant system and develop operations Piping & Instrument Diagrams (P&ID) as built. I've provided support for the operations engineering as needed for plant distribution performance optimization, built and managed the plant site database with latest CAD.

In 2018, I finished my Bachelor of Science (B.Sc) in Mechanical Engineering at [Drexel University](https://drexel.edu) with CGPA of 3.75. During my final year of my studies, I've competed in [Senior Design Search and Rescue Challenge](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Lbk-PPCJqAlKEuM58Gpkwn-D825f-1CY/view?usp=drive_open) as part of my senior design project, and my team was under the supervision of [John Lacontora](https://drexel.edu/engineering/about/faculty-staff/L/lacontora-john/). My interests are currently vested in applications of autonomous air and space systems. I will continue to do more research and looking for any opportunity to be involved more in that area.

Past projects during my studies at Drexel University; [Soil Sample Underwater Robot](https://drive.google.com/open?id=17hmRjR1caxTCNCYaRRxccCg2CG8pN1VV), [Aircraft Design and Performance Project](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Okxsmg5Oprv7-LU-fcCWIZlJAWUcyux5/view?usp=sharing), Water Hammer Neutralizer.
